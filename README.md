# AIML Classification Model

This project builds and evaluates a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species based on their physical measurements.

## How to Run

1. Install required Python libraries:

2. Run the main classification script:

## Whatâ€™s Included

- `classification_model.py`: Main Python script for training and evaluating the model.
- `app.py`: Optional application script for making predictions interactively.
- `final_iris_rf_model.pkl`: Saved Random Forest model after training and tuning.
- `dataset.csv`: The Iris dataset used for training/testing.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Features

- Loads and splits the Iris dataset into training and testing sets.
- Trains a Random Forest classifier with hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluates model accuracy and generates reports and confusion matrices.
- Compares with other classifiers like SVM, KNN, and Logistic Regression.
- Visualizes feature importance.
- Saves the trained model for future use.

## Next Steps

- Build a user-friendly interface (like a web app) to predict results from new inputs.
- Deploy the model and interface to a server for easy access.
- Experiment with new models or improve data processing.
